## GiftShare (WIP)

## Motivation

Sharing Christmas and Birthday lists is always a pain when there are a large number of people. This is my attempt to alleviate some of that burden. This service allows you to add items to a list, and share that list with others. Once shared, other users will be able to claim items from your list. Once claimed these items will not appear to other users and importantly, you will not be able to tell that the item was claimed or who claimed it.
